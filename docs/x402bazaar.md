# x402 Bazaar (Discovery Layer)

The x402 Bazaar is the discovery layer for the x402 ecosystem - a machine-readable catalog that helps developers and AI agents find and integrate with x402-compatible API endpoints. Think of it as a search index for payable APIs, enabling the autonomous discovery and consumption of services.

<Note>
  The x402 Bazaar is in early development. While our vision is to build the "Google for agentic endpoints," we're currently more like "Yahoo search" - functional but evolving. Features and APIs may change as we gather feedback and expand capabilities.
</Note>

## Overview

The Bazaar solves a critical problem in the x402 ecosystem: **discoverability**. Without it, x402-compatible endpoints are like hidden stalls in a vast market. The Bazaar provides:

* **For Buyers (API Consumers)**: Programmatically discover available x402-enabled services, understand their capabilities, pricing, and schemas
* **For Sellers (API Providers)**: Automatic visibility for your x402-enabled services to a global audience of developers and AI agents
* **For AI Agents**: Dynamic service discovery without pre-baked integrations - query, find, pay, and use

## How It Works

The Bazaar currently provides a simple `/list` endpoint that returns all x402-compatible services registered with the CDP facilitator. If your API uses the latest version of the CDP facilitator for x402 payments, it's ingested in the bazaar if you make the discoverable flag true in the input schema (see [Quickstart for Sellers](#quickstart-for-sellers)).

### Basic Flow

1. **Discovery**: Clients query the `/list` endpoint to find available services
2. **Selection**: Choose a service based on price, capabilities, and requirements
3. **Execution**: Use x402 to pay for and access the selected service
4. **No Manual Setup**: No API keys, no account creation, just discover and pay

## API Reference

### List Endpoint

Retrieve all available x402-compatible endpoints:

```bash
GET https://api.cdp.coinbase.com/platform/v2/x402/discovery/resources
```

Note: the recommended way to use this endpoint is to use the `useFacilitator` hook as described [below](#quickstart-for-buyers).

#### Response Schema

Each endpoint in the list contains the following fields:

```json
{
      "accepts": [
        {
          "asset": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913", // ERC-20 token contract address accepted for payment (here, USDC on Base)
          "description": "", // Optional description of the accepted payment
          "extra": {
            "name": "USD Coin", // Human-readable name of the asset
            "version": "2" // Version of the asset, if applicable
          },
          "maxAmountRequired": "200", // Maximum amount (in atomic units, e.g USDC has 6 decimals) required for the service
          "maxTimeoutSeconds": 60, // Maximum time (in seconds) the service will wait for payment before expiring
          "mimeType": "", // Expected MIME type for the response (optional/empty if not specified)
          "network": "base", // network where payment is accepted (e.g., 'base' for Base L2)
          "outputSchema": {
            "input": {
              "method": "GET", // HTTP method to use when calling the resource
              "type": "http" // Type of resource (e.g., 'http' endpoint)
            },
            "output": null // Output schema (null if not specified)
          },
          "payTo": "0xa2477E16dCB42E2AD80f03FE97D7F1a1646cd1c0", // Address to which payment should be sent
          "resource": "https://api.example.com/x402/last_sold", // The actual API endpoint/resource URL
          "scheme": "exact" // Payment scheme (e.g., 'exact' means exact amount required)
        }
      ],
      "lastUpdated": "2025-08-09T01:07:04.005Z", 
      "metadata": {}, // Additional metadata about the service (empty object if none)
      "resource": "https://api.prixe.io/x402/last_sold", // The main resource URL for this service
      "type": "http", 
      "x402Version": 1 // Version of the x402 protocol supported
    },
```

## Quickstart for Buyers

See the full example here for [Python](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/main/examples/python/discovery) and [Node.js](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/main/examples/typescript/discovery).

### Step 1: Discover Available Services

Fetch the list of available x402 services using the facilitator client:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```typescript
    import { useFacilitator } from "x402/verify";
    import { facilitator } from "@coinbase/x402";

    // Get the list function from the facilitator
    const { list } = useFacilitator(facilitator);

    // Fetch all available services
    const services = await list();

    // NOTE: in an MCP context, you can see the full list then decide which service to use

    // Find services under $0.10
    const usdcAsset = "0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e";
    const maxPrice = 100000;

    const affordableServices = services.items.filter(item => item.accepts.find(paymentRequirements => paymentRequirements.asset == usdcAsset && Number(paymentRequirements.maxAmountRequired) < maxPrice));
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    from x402.facilitator import FacilitatorClient, FacilitatorConfig
    from cdp.x402 import create_facilitator_config

    # Set up facilitator client
    facilitator_config = create_facilitator_config()
    facilitator = FacilitatorClient(facilitator_config)

    # Fetch all available services
    services = await facilitator.list()

    # NOTE: in an MCP context, you can see the full list then decide which service to use

    # Find services under $0.10
    usdc_asset = "0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e"
    max_price = 100000

    affordable_services = [
      item
      for item in services.items
      if any(
        payment_req.asset == usdc_asset
        and int(payment_req.max_amount_required) < max_price
        for payment_req in item.accepts
       )
      ]
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Call a Discovered Service

Once you've found a suitable service, use an x402 client to call it:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```typescript
    import { withPaymentInterceptor } from 'x402-axios';
    import axios from 'axios';
    import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts';

    // Set up your payment account
    const account = privateKeyToAccount('0xYourPrivateKey');

    // Select a service from discovery
    const selectedService = affordableServices[0];

    // Create a payment-enabled client for that service
    const client = withPaymentInterceptor(
      axios.create({ baseURL: selectedService.endpoint }), 
      account
    );

    // Select the payment method of your choice
    const selectedPaymentRequirements = selectedService.accepts[0];
    const inputSchema = selectedPaymentRequirements.outputSchema.input;

    // Build the request using the service's schema
    const response = await client.request({
      method: inputSchema.method,
      url: inputSchema.resource,
      params: { location: 'San Francisco' } // Based on inputSchema
    });

    console.log('Response data:', response.data);
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    from x402.client import X402Client
    from eth_account import Account

    # Set up your payment account
    account = Account.from_key('0xYourPrivateKey')
    client = X402Client(account)

    # Select a service from discovery
    selected_service = affordable_services[0]

    # Select the payment method of your choice
    selected_payment_requirements = selected_service.accepts[0]
    input_schema = selected_payment_requirements.output_schema.input

    # Make the request
    response = client.request({
        method=input_schema.method,
        url=input_schema.resource,
        params={ "location": "San Francisco" } # Based on input_schema
    })

    print(f"Response data: {response}")
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Quickstart for Sellers

### Automatic Listing with Discoverable Flag

If your API uses the latest version of the CDP facilitator for x402 payments, it's ingested in the bazaar if you make the discoverable flag true in the input schema (see below).

### Adding Metadata

To enhance your listing with descriptions and schemas, include them when setting up your x402 middleware. You should include descriptions for each parameter to make it clear for the agent to call your endpoints:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```typescript
    // Next.js / Express / Hono
    import { paymentMiddleware, Network } from 'x402-express'; // or x402-next or x402-hono

    app.use(paymentMiddleware({
      routes: {
        "/api/weather": {
          price: "$0.001",
          network: "base",
          config: {
            discoverable: true, // make your endpoint discoverable
            description: "Get current weather data for any location",
            inputSchema: { 
              queryParams: { 
                location: { 
                  type: string, 
                  description: "City name or coordinates", 
                  required: true
                }
              }
            },
            outputSchema: {
              type: "object",
              properties: { 
                temperature: { type: "number" },
                conditions: { type: "string" },
                humidity: { type: "number" }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }));
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    # FastAPI / Flask
    from x402 import require_payment

    app.middleware("http")(
        require_payment(
            path="/weather",
            price="$0.001",
            pay_to_address=WALLET_ADDRESS,
            network="base",
            description="Get current weather data for any location",
            discoverable=true, # make your endpoint discoverable <----
            input_schema={
                "queryParams": {
                    "location": {
                        "type": string,
                        "description": "City name or coordinates",
                        "required": true
                    }
                }
            },
            output_schema={
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "temperature": {"type": "number"},
                    "conditions": {"type": "string"},
                    "humidity": {"type": "number"}
                }
            }
        )
    )
    ```

## FAQ

**Q: How do I get my service listed?**
A: If you're using the CDP facilitator, your service is listed once you include the discoverable flag

**Q: How can I make endpoint calls more accurate?**
A: Include descriptions clearly stating what each parameter does and how to call your endpoint, but do so as succinctly as possible.

**Q: Can I opt out of the Bazaar?**
A: Soon, will be able to manage your listing preferences.

**Q: How does pricing work?**
A: Listing is free. Services set their own prices per API call, paid via x402.

**Q: What networks are supported?**
A: Currently Base (mainnet) with USDC payments.

**Q: Can I list non-x402 services?**
A: No, only x402-compatible endpoints can be listed. See our [seller quickstart](/x402/quickstart-for-sellers) to make your API x402-compatible.
